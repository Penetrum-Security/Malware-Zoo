# Penetrum Malware Zoo

Unfortuanltey for us our malware sample zoo is too big for Github with a total of 7,124 (at the time of writing) files and always growing it seems that we have no choice but to create a zoo on our website. **We are currently in the process of creating the malware zoo and will be updating this README the second it is finished**. In order to access the zoo we will require registration, to register please follow [this](https://penetrum.com/signup) link, signup, confirm your email, and login. From there you will have the option to go to our malware zoo and can download files until your heart is content. 

The files in the zoo ARE NOT the same files uploaded on our malware analysis tool, Malcore. To use this tool you can go [here](https://penetrum.com/upload) and get your malware analyzed. This tool does not share uploaded malware samples with thirdparty companies and is therefore safe to use under NDA (the hash will be publicaly searchable). All files in the zoo have been run inside of Malcore at one point or another (most anyways), and are already publicaly available for searching.

# File Hashes

After you have signed up you will be able to get the file hashes from the malware samples and look them up on other systems (such as virustotal). Do so by clicking the "SHOW HASHES" button. From there the hashes will be generated and you will be presented with the MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512, imphash (if applicable), and ssdeep hash. 

# Types of Malware

In our zoo there are multiple types of malware such as APT doc malware, keyloggers, trojans, remote adminstration tools, exploits, ransomware, and much more.

# Searching

Yes it is possible to search for hashes in the malware zoo. You do so by searching for the SHA256 hash on the top.

# Why?

Penetrum has one of the largest opensource malware zoo's on the market and we are constantly adding new files to it, by the end of this month we are expecting to add 10,000 new files to the zoo.
